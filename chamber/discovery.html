      <figcaption>The Castle of San Anton was built in the 16th century, fulfilling defensive and prison functions; 
        later it was used as a pesthouse to isolate sailors who arrived in the city affected by an infectious disease. 
        In 1968 it was inaugurated as an archaeological museum and has been considered a historical-artistic monument since 1994. 
        The museum houses archeology objects such as: protohistoric goldsmithing, megalithism, the Bronze Age, castro culture,

      <img src="images/placeholder.png" data-src="images/torre-hercules.png" alt="Tower of Hercules">   
      <figcaption>Tower of Hercules, the oldest lighthouse in the world still in operation. Centuries before Christ, 
        there was a town of Celtic origin known as Brigantia in the bay of A Coruña, inhabited by the Ártabros. 
        It served as a lighthouse during the centuries of Romanization, until in the 5th century, 
        the Norman attacks forced the inhabitants to abandon it, and to take refuge inside. In the 18th century, the tower 
        regained its prominence and function as a lighthouse. 2000 years ago the ancient lighthouse lit its light for the first time, 
        becoming a point of reference for sailors and a must-see for travellers. Hence, the Tower of Hercules was declared a World Heritage 
        Site in 2009.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>It is the house where the painter Pablo Picasso lived between 1891 and 1895, as a child. 
        It is a typical house of the 19th century extension area in La Coruña and it is kept with the same 
        things that existed when the Ruiz Picasso family lived there: furniture, objects and original equipment.
        Among the works (the originals of which are preserved in other museums) are oil on canvas, oil on wood, 
        pen and pencil drawings, inks, charcoals and watercolours.

      <img src="images/placeholder.png" data-src="images/santa-cruz.png" alt="Santa Cruz Castle">
      <figcaption>The Santa Cruz Castle was built in the 16th century with the aim of completing the defensive 
        system of the Coruña bay. After losing its strategic function, it became, already in the 19th century, 
        the residence of the daughter of the writer Emilia Pardo Bazán. It is at this time when the castle dependencies 
        are reconstructed, giving the central building the shape of a country house as we know it today. After the death 
        of the Countess, it was donated, in 1938, to the Cavalry Army, becoming a summer residence for military orphans until 1988.
        The Castle of Santa Cruz was declared an Asset of Cultural Interest due to its high historical interest, which, together 
        with its natural and landscape beauty, make this place an extraordinary place.</figcaption>

         From the top of Monte de San Pedro you can see the coming and going of the boats guided by 
         the ancient lighthouse. You will be impressed by the presence of the immense canyons. War machines 
         that used to defend the city and now point to the horizon so that no one misses the best sunset.</figcaption>
